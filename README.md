This repository contains the code for the volume estimation of objects using <b>Kinect V1</b> RGBD camera.
The code primarily returns the volume for 4 different shapes based on the dimensions estimated by converting the raw camera feed to real world coordinates:

<ul>
    <li> Sphere
    <li> Cuboid
    <li> Cylinder
    <li> Prism
</ul>

To setup the software clone the repository, open a terminal and navigate to the directory of cloned repo. Then execute the following command:

```
./setup.sh
./run.sh
```
**Note:** If you face an error while running the ```run.sh``` script, please run the main.py python script inside the new virtaul environment created.
